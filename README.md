# testing
# This project is a simulated website for a pc building company.
# I used bootstrap for basically every other thing in this project. I used it for the carousel and the filter which are the biggest parts of the website. I also used it for the
# headings. bootstrap is awesome.
# Some of the pages along with the "other" thing on the navigation dont work or dont do anything. So, if I had or if I get more time I will add more pages and add a bit more content like more pcs for the filter and more filter options.
